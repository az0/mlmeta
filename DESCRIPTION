Description: Generates Base SAS code to score models learned in R.  Supports
    artificial neural networks, conditional inference trees, random forests,
    and gradient boosting regression models.  The SAS code often runs faster
    than R, uses less memory, and does not require SAS/STAT or SAS/IML.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.16)
