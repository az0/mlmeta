Description: Generates Base SAS code to score models learned in R.  Supports
    artificial neural networks, conditional inference trees, random forests,
    gradient boosting regression models, and multivariate adaptive regression
    splines. The SAS code often runs faster than R, uses less memory, and does
    not require SAS/STAT or SAS/IML.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.16)
