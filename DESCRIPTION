Description: Generates Base SAS code to score models learned in R. Supports
    artificial neural networks, bagged MARS, conditional inference trees, random
    forests, gradient boosting regression models, and multivariate adaptive
    regression splines (MARS). The SAS code often runs faster than R, uses less
    memory, and does not require SAS/STAT or SAS/IML.
Depends:
